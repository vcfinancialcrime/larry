TEXAS BUSINESS AND COMMERCE CODE:<br><br>
Deceptive Trade Practices-Consumer Protection Act<br>
(DTPA)
</h2>

<br><br>
<ul class="legalcode">

<h3 class="legalcode">KEY TERMINOLOGY </h3>
<p></p>
<ul class="legalcode"></ul>
<li>The Deceptive Trade Practices-Consumer Protection Act defines the following key terms:
    <ul>
	<li>“<span id="mark">false</span>, <span id="mark">misleading</span>, or <span id="mark">deceptive</span> acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are hereby declared unlawful” </li>
    <li>“<span id="mark">service</span>" includes work, parts, and labor furnished in connection with the repair of goods, and </li>
    <li>“<b><span id="mark"><font color="red">unconscionable action</font></span></b>” in one that “takes advantage of the lack of knowledge, ability, experience, or capacity of a person to a grossly unfair degree.”</li>
</ul>


<h3 class="legalcode">
SECTION 17.46 - DECEPTIVE TRADE PRACTICES UNLAWFUL
</h3>
<p></p>
<ul class="legalcode">
<li>(a)	False, misleading, or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are hereby declared unlawful and are subject to action by the consumer protection division under certain sections of this code [Sections 17.47, 17.58, 17.60, and 17.61].</li>
<li>(b)	The term “false, misleading, or deceptive acts or practices” includes, but is not limited to, the [unlawful] following acts [except as provided in Subsection (d) of this section]:
    <p></p>
<ul class="legalcode">
    <li><b>The Unlawful Acts, or DTPA Violations, by Black Forest Werkshop:</b><p></p>
        <ul class="legalcode">

<li><b>(#01)	 Passing off goods or services as those of another</b><br>
<i>It is illegal to advertise or represent goods or services under a different company than the company in which the goods were made or the services received.</li></i><br>

<li><b>(#02)	 Causing confusion or misunderstanding as to the source, sponsorship, approval, or certification of goods or services</b><br>
<i>This section prohibits acts that tend to confuse consumers. First, this section prohibits acts that tend to cause confusion regarding the source of goods or services. This section is broader than section (1) because the consumer need not prove that the defendant was actually "passing off" goods or services as those of another. Instead, all the consumer must show is that the defendant caused confusion regarding the source of the goods or services.</li></i><br>

<li><b>(#03)	 Causing confusionor misunderstanding as to the affiliation, connection, or association with, or certification by, another</b><br>
<i>This section prohibits acts or practices that cause confusion regarding the affiliation or relationship between the seller of goods or the provider of services and some other organization or person. For example, this section prohibits business owners from giving the impression that their company is closely connected with another business or with the state government or an agency of the state government.</li></i><br>


<li><b>(#06)	 Representing that goods are original or new if they are deteriorated, reconditioned, reclaimed, used, or secondhand</b><br>
<i>This section prohibits sellers from passing off secondhand or reconditioned goods as new. This section affects many types of goods which might be sold, used on a trial basis, returned and then sold again as "new." The Federal Trade Commission has guidelines regarding the amount of prior use that is allowed before a good can no longer be sold or advertised as "new."</li></i><br>


<li><b>(#13)    Knowingly making false or misleading statements of fact concerning the need for parts, replacement, or repair service</b><br>
<i>This section prohibits repairpersons from representing that certain work or parts are needed when they are not. To violate this section the repairperson must have made the misrepresentation "knowingly." This is required because there may be honest differences of opinion regarding the need for some repairs.</li></i><br>


<li><b>(#22)   Representing that work or services have been performed on, or parts replaced in, goods when the work or services were not performed or the parts replaced</b><br>
<i>While section (13) prohibits persons from "knowingly" making false or misleading statements concerning the need for parts, replacement, or repairs, this section requires no proof of knowledge or intent. Instead, it is illegal for a repair shop or service person to tell you that certain parts have been replaced or certain services have been performed when they have not.</li></i><br>


<li><b>(#24)     Failing to disclose information concerning goods or services that was known at the time of the transaction if such failure to disclose such information was intended to induce the consumer into a transaction into which the consumer would not have entered had the information been disclosed</b><br>
<i>This section prohibits a seller from failing to disclose information known by the seller at the time of the transaction if such withholding of information is intended to induce the consumer into a transaction, and if the information is such that had the consumer known it at the time of the transaction, the consumer would not have made the purchases. </li></i><br>
        </ul></li></ul></li></ul>

<p></p>
<h3 class="legalcode">SECTION 17.50 – RELIEF FOR CONSUMERS</h3>
<ul class="legalcode">
    <li>When consumers suffer actual damages, they may sue under the DTPA for any of the following:
        <ul class="legalcode">
            <li><b>[A]</b>	False, misleading, or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce which were relied upon by the consumer to his or her detriment,</li>
            <li><b>[B]</b>	Breach of contract or an expressed or implied warranty</li>
            <li><b>[C]</b>	Unconscionable action, and</li>
            <li><b>[D]</b>	Certain violations of the Texas Insurance Code.</li>

And this was back we actually had a body shop that big white building over there was our body shop. We used to be across the street.</p>

<p class="audiotext"><b>AUDIO TRANSCRIPTION "B"</b><br>
  The reality of it is like, if you wanted this car, like looking like it just came off the showroom floor. Then it would have gone over to Jeff's Body Shop. *** Jeff's Body Shop *** Jeff's body shop? *** He does immaculate work. *** Where's he located? *** He's overthere on Lamar, and so had we gone that route. What would have happened in the car would still be there, by the way. *** They have a long line? *** Yeah, I just called it a one on one, and I can't even get the car over there until January. </p>

    Alright, Jaden, I'm glad you're finally back in your car *** Me too *** Yeah, I think Josh would prefer that I don't ever get involved in any body repair stuff. I'm just trying to help people out, you know, try to help you out with a good price to get this stuff done.</p>

<p class="audiocomment"><b>PERSONAL COMMENTARY</b><br>Why is Lee taking on business for customers with body damage if his shop no longer directly provides body damage repair services? Why is Lee negotiating the cost of repairing body damage with the insurance companies and customers if his shop is not the company doing the repair work, and what control does Lee have over scheduling/prioritizing a any aspect of a customer's body repair if his shop isn't the one doing the repair work?</p></li>

Or put the stock ones back in there. To go back home with this. You could go back home with this. *** Yeah, I'm afraid of that causing any more damage to the battery or any other electrical components. *** It's all part of what happens when you start going with aftermarket stuff. *** That's the same stuff that I think StateFarm asks you to buy through aftermarket stuff. *** But they do that crap all the time. And you know what, I charge the hell out of them for having to mess with it. I get them from all kinds of computer time and testing and diagnosing and blah, blah, blah and ultimately call and say now do you want me to put the stock ones in?</p>

That guy just left here driving since I got him I used one of these controller wheels. And he said you know what? After I'd warned him about use parts he said just order a new one Lee. I said, thank you, <b>Mike</b>. problem with these cars when they're on the showroom floor or What was this about a $40,000 car 35,000 40,000 maybe 45,000. *** For a BMW, I'm sure. Yeah. *** But if you went to the parts counter and said, I want to buy that car, but I want to buy it in parts because I'm gonna go home and build it myself because I like building cars. And they sold you all the parts for this car over the counter. This will turn into a half-a-million dollar car this in parts alone the parts prices will cost probably a half a million dollars.</p>
  
<p class="audiocomment"><b>PERSONAL COMMENTARY</b><br>This sound clip sounds like it might provide Lee's logic, reasoning, and/or <font color="red"><b>motivation</b></font> for running certain aspects of his business the way that he does. It sounds like there is a lot of money that can be made through the purchasing of parts, especially the re-purchasing of OEM factory parts when his shop's original repair work fails to meet his customer's base level of satisfaction. Per his 11/17/2021 email Black Forest also charges a 30% mark-up on parts whenever they are able to do so when it appears that the industry standard is 25%.</p></li>

Some guy came in. And I think it was GEICO or Progressive. And they wouldn't let us put genuine parts on the guy's car. And I told him I said you can pay the difference. So we'll use genuine parts. I said, But these aren't gonna fit, right. And he was like, Well, I'm not paying any more than my deductible. So use whatever they tell you to use, which was the right way for him to go. Because the way it worked out was when he went to came pick up this car. He was running his hand down, like look, there's a gap here, right there and blah, blah. And he want us to try to readjust them. And I said, now we've adjusted them as good as they can be. I said now what you have to do is call your adjuster meeting back over here. I said I want you to meet him with me here. You don't want to meet him by yourself because it'll snowball you. So fortunately, that meeting worked out. The guy showed up with his car on time the adjuster was there on time. And so the adjuster actually admitted yeah, these don't fit. And he looked at me and he said, Why didn't y'all test it these pieces before you painted it? And I said show me on your paperwork that you were gonna pay me to test fit this stuff. I said you already know I said you just admitted that, you know, these aftermarket parts don't fit. And now you're telling me I should have tested them? I said no, I don't do that. You know, unless you're gonna pay me to do it. I'm not gonna do it. The adjuster was like, well, I'll pay for factory parts, but I'm not paying you to paint him again, not flicked at the owner of the car, I said, I hope you like Primer Gray, because that's how they come. And if he's not paying me to paint them, then we're not painting them. And the poor owner of the car, you know, the consumer shouldn't get stuck in the middle of this garbage. And that poor guy was like, he didn't know what to do. And the adjuster said, I can't believe how some people run their businesses. And I said, Now you just said something that I think we both can agree on. I said, I can't believe how you guys run your business. And he finally agreed to completely redo the whole front end work that we had done. So we put factory parts on, we repainted it, and everything. And they paid us twice to do that job.</p>

<p class="audiocomment"><b>PERSONAL COMMENTARY</b><br>My experience with Black Forest Werkshop and Lee's stories all have a very familiar feel to them by this point. It seems as though he repeatedly engages in questionable behaviors that lead to customers being unhappy with the quality of work his shop does and then convincing the insurance companies and his customers to let him re-do the work a second time using more expensive parts. </p></li>

We had one insurance company. So they were given us the runaround, on just replacing a windshield. And after going through three different windshield companies, we finally got the windshield in and it took months to get this done months. It was unbelievable how long, the car would still be here. If I wasn't the one who kept calling saying what do I want to do whatever I want to do. And then the way it normally works, is whatever the stuff is they tell us to use, they already know how much our cost is. And they pay us 25% above whatever our cost is for our profit margin. And the windshield, the guy's car. And so I called Binswanger. I said, Hey, you guys didn't leave an invoice, I need to pay you for this. And they said, Oh, we've already been paid. I said, Who paid you and they said, well, the insurance company is paying us directly. So they totally screwed me out of any penny I ever hoped to make on getting that windshield done, you know, for all my management stuff and everything. And so I called the owner and told him, I said, I need you to help me out with this. I said, I'm not going to do this. But I want you to kind of go along with it. I said you don't owe me any favors. This is a business. I said, so what I'm going to do is I'm going to pay you 25% or whatever I get out of these bastards. And they said, Okay, what do you want me to do? I said, call him up and tell them that I'm going to sell your car to pay for the storage fees. Because I've been storing the car here while they're guys not been getting the jobs done. And in the end, the insurance company paid me over $3,000 for storage. And if they would let me just do the windshield, it would have been 1200 bucks. And so I paid the owner of the car, I didn't charge him his deductible, I gave him an extra 250 bucks, and I kept the rest of the money. And that's how it goes with this insurance stuff. I mean, it's it's crazy.</p> 
   
<p class="audiocomment"><b>PERSONAL COMMENTARY</b><br>My experience with Black Forest Werkshop and Lee's stories are still resonating with my own experiences with him. Lee made a similar offer to me. We discussed storage fees and leveraging the componding storage fees as a bargainig chip to try to convince StateFarm to approve a high payout.</p></li>

    There was a temperature sensor on one guy's car the other day, and a mouse had gotten in there and chewed it up, and it had been like that for months. He brought the car in and we fixed it, and then he called me two days later and said I don't think your guy did a good job, this temperature sensor is not reading right again. They brought it over.

  <p class="audiocomment"><b>PERSONAL COMMENTARY</b><br>Another story of a Black Forest Werkshop customer who was dissatsfied with the results and had Lee re-do the work, it sounds like he paid for multiple parts.

Every story is involves long turn around times, complicated insurance interations, disatisfied customers, and/or re-doing work.

<p class="audiocomment"><b>PERSONAL COMMENTARY</b><br>I took my BMW to Caliber Collision Onion Creek, a certified BMW repair facility, to get an estimate on how much it would cost to do the original repair work Black Forest Werkshop failed to do, and to fix the additional damage caused by Black Forest Werkshop. Caliber Collisions refused to lay a hand on my car, even to asses the damages to provide a repair estimate because they did not want to inadvertently put themselves in a position where they might be held legally liable for the damages caused by Black Forest Werkshop. Caliber Collision's said that even if I agreed to pay the full cost of the repair out-of-pocket, it would be difficult to find a quality repair venue that would even be willing to work on my BMW given its current circumstance of being grossly damaged as a result of a "botched" repair job completed by a different repair shop, especially since BMW's are technically nuanced and expensive cars.</p></li>

<h3>Front Bumper : Before Repairs (left), In-Picture Embedded Commentary (middle), and After Repairs (right)</h3>

<div class="indent">
<p>My vehicle was at Black Forest Werkshop for 84 days. These images show what my car looked like before I dropped the car off for repairs and what it ultimately looked like when I left the repair shop with my vehicle. My car looked different when I arrived at the shop on December 18, 2021, to pick up my car. While I was there to pick up my vehicle I had Black Forst Werkshop address some of my outstanding concerns. I had them complete some of the work they missed and repair some of the new issues they created before I left with my vehicle. My car was in the shop for 84 days to repair what my insurance company and other body shops have labeled "common" and "minor body damage" which would normally take only a few days to repair.</p>

<b>The <font color="red">red text</font> embedded in the middle image above reads:</b>
<br>
<br>
Prior to choosing Black Forest Werkshop, and on the day I dropped my car off for repairs, the shop owner, Lee Rector, said that he could repair my car using the parts I purchased. After having my vehicle for over 70+ days he then changed his tune, gave various excuses why he couldn't use the parts I purchased, why they would not work, and tried to sell me parts with a 30% upcharge (profit margin). It was now too late to return the parts I purchased. All of the parts I purchased do fit and work with my car.
<br>
<br>
1) On December 13, 2021, on a three-way call with StateFarm the shop owner said the reason my car still wasn't finished was because he needed a replacement headlight. on that call, he offered to procure a used headlight to 'finish up' the repairs and have the car ready for me by the 15th. StateFarm agreed to extend my rental car through Dec 15th (80 days of car rental). My vehicle was not ready on the 15th. on the 18th the shop owner presented me with a final bill that charged me twice for the headlight parts.
<br>
<br>
2) When I arrived to pick up my car I was surprised to find the original gray-colored front grill pieces had been reinstalled. I purchased black grill replacement parts which were sitting on top of the back seat of my car. I convinced the shop owner, Lee Rector, to 'try' to install the black parts I originally asked him to use. He did. They installed the front black grill parts while I watched. This should have been completed before I arrived to pick up my car.
<br>
<br>
3) The fog lights I purchased were used by Black Forest Werkshop to complete my repairs, but they were negligently installed. The car registered an electrical error and the fog lights flickered on and off even when the car was turned off. Even though the shop owner offered to let me take my car home with the unfinished repairs and these new electrical defects, I refused to leave until they fixed the electrical issues, which they did as I watched and assisted. The fog light trim pieces I purchased were not installed either. When I arrived to pick up my car I was surprised to find that the front [and the back] of my car still looked like it had been in an accident. The shop owner gave me instructions on how to find these missing front pieces and install them myself.</i>

<h3>Rear Bumper: Before and After (84 days later) Pictures are Identical</h3>
<div class="indent">
<p>Note: I fully expected my rear bumper to be repaired and was surprised to find that no repair work at all was completed on my rear bumper even though I was expecting it to be fully repaired. The rear of my car looks exactly the same as it did before I dropped my vehicle off for repair and after picking the car up 84 days later from the repair shop. </p>

<p>Lee, ...</p>

<p>I have some questions and concerns regarding multiple aspects of this business transaction. I will be taking some time to seek guidance from objective professionals who are more knowledgeable than me on the most appropriate next steps for me to take on how to justly and amicably conclude our business arrangement.</p>

<p>Because I am soliciting others for guidance and advice, I must allow an appropriate amount of time and flexibility for correspondence to occur. You will receive additional information regarding my decision to proceed no later than the close of business on Monday, February 28, 2022, which is 60 days from 12/30/2021, the date you emailed me regarding my declined payment.</p> 

<p>I will not reply to further communications, contact you again, or remit any payment before receiving the clarity and guidance I seek from knowledgeable and objective resources or before the close of business on Monday, February 28, 2022, whichever comes first.</p> 

<p>Regards, Jaden Riley</p>

<p><a name="police2">&#8225;</a> = <i>I wasn't sure what to expect when picking up my car at Black Forest Werkshop and I called the City of Austin non-emergency police contact number on Dec. 16, 2021, to see if I could get a police escort to come with me to pick up my vehicle. The agent on the phone said my concerns sounded more like civil matters rather than active crime and therefore law enforcement could not/would not be dispatched to assist me. A few minutes after ending this call I met a police officer who was driving around Murchison Middle School (Austin, Texas) on night patrol (Dec. 16, 2021, ~08:00 PM). We talked for close to an hour. The officer I spoke with also advised me that law enforcement would not be able to assist me by escorting me to the repair shop to pick up my vehicle because it seemed more of a civil than an active criminal matter.</i>(<a href="#police1">&#8224;</a>) (<a href="#police2">&#8225;</a>)</p>

<p></p><i>To be fair as possible, I billed my time out at the lowest of the three hourly rates noted in the repair estimates, which is $73/hr for paint labor, and this rate is consistent with my profession, as Senior Microsoft Cloud Architect. Furthermore, Lee Rector charges $60/day just to permit a customer's car to sit ideally in his lot, while I have been dealing with this issue for 419 days of my life, and from a position of Justice, my daily time, effort, and energy must certainly be considered a more valuable commodity than daily storage space in a parking lot (please see the <a href="https://dtpa.github.io/lawsuit/#timeline"><b>Timeline</b></a>). My time is just as valuable as the mechanic, painters, auto repair technicians, and lawyers. In truth, my time is more valuable because my time wasn't freely given or asked for; it was forced away from me. I should be compensated for my time in the exact same manner as is classified [my time is an Economic Damage] just as the other individuals who devoted time to this situation, and <u>my Total Economic Damages Amount should then be used to determine my Punitive Damages</u>. </i></p>
